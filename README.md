A node server implementing GraphQL API spec
Inspired from the tutorial https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction/

## Introduction
GraphQL is the rising star of backend technologies. It replaces REST as an API design paradigm and is becoming the new standard for exposing the data and functionality of a server.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to build an idiomatic GraphQL server entirely from scratch. You are going to use the following technologies:

__graphql-yoga:__ Fully-featured GraphQL server with focus on easy setup, performance & great developer experience. It is built on top of Express, apollo-server, graphql-js and more.

__Prisma:__ Prisma replaces traditional ORMs. Use the Prisma client to implement your GraphQL resolvers and simplify database access

__GraphQL Playground:__ “GraphQL IDE” that allows to interactively explore the functionality of a GraphQL API by sending queries and mutations to it. It’s somewhat similar to Postman which offers comparable functionality for REST APIs. Among other things, a GraphQL Playground…

  - … auto-generates a comprehensive documentation for all available API operations.
  - … provides an editor where you can write queries, mutations & subscriptions, with auto-completion(!) and syntax     highlighting.
  - … lets you easily share your API operations.
